> A mobile app that guides you in your mental health journey.
>
> Peace Pulce, your dedicated mental health companion. Our app seamlessly connects you with a psychiatrist, considering your preferences and therapeutic needs. Engage in transformative video sessions. Receive daily resources tailored to your mental health journey, while also benefiting from a compassionate community of like-minded individuals. Trained volunteers are available to offer empathetic support during challenging moments. Track your progress with personalized dashboards and collaborate with your psychiatrist to set and achieve goals.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want a space where I can talk about my problems, provide quick access to calming resources when I feel overwhelmed, offer guided relaxation exercises and breathing techniques to help me manage and reduce stress levels.
- As a therapist, I want the app to have secure communication channels for virtual sessions with my clients, ensuring confidentiality and convenience.
- As a volunteer, I aim to share my self-development journey with those in need, providing them the resources and mindsets I encoporate in my daily life.

###  Peace Pulce is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.

<!-- Prototyping -->

> We designed Peace Pulce using wireframes, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
