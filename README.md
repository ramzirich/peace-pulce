###  Peace Pulce is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React native](https://reactnative.dev/) app development framework. React native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- The backend uses the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/). Laravel is a robust PHP framework that enables developpers to create web or mobile applications. It offers features and tools optimized for building dynamic applications.
- For voice calls, the app uses [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/). A librairy for real time communication capabilities that work on top of an open standard. Voice is send between peers.
- The project integrates [OpenAi](https://openai.com/). It provides a versatile set of tools for natural language processing to provide assistance to our users with their problems.
